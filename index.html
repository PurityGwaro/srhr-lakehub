                Sexual Reproductive Health is a human right.Sexual and reproductive health and rights 
                (SRHR) is an essential building block to achieving gender equality, but it’s restricted globally.
                Families everywhere are trapped in cycles of poverty because they do not have the option to 
                plan when to have children or decide how big they want their family to be. Meanwhile, countries 
                that do not categorize rape as a crime put the lives of women and girls at risk daily, and the
                COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted access to HIV/AIDS services — leaving some of the most vulnerable
                populations without care. <br>When people’s sexual and reproductive health and rights 
                are denied, their well-being is threatened. People who live in poverty are disproportionately 
                impacted by the lack of access to their full health care rights.Funding for sexual and reproductive 
                health and rights can support health education and resources, contraception, maternal health care, and more.

                    <p>Most people who are denied SRHR are women, men, and young people living in poverty in 
                developing countries. Lack of access to SRHR can result in a range of negative outcomes. </p>

                    <h3 class="heading">How Can We Ensure Everyone Has Access to SRHR? </h3>
                    <p>Lack of political will, inadequate resources and funding, and discrimination against women and girls
                 all prevent full access to SRHR worldwide. <br>
                Ensuring everyone is protected by SRHR doesn't have just one solution, but it includes initiatives 
                such as comprehensive sexuality education, access to a range of modern contraceptives, antenatal 
                childbirth and postnatal care, safe abortion services and treatment of complications of unsafe abortion, 
                and prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. </p>
