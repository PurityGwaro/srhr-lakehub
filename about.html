        Adolescent girls and young women in Africa have high unmet needs 
        for mordern contraception according to statistics done over the years.
        <br>
        In 2019, an estimated 270 million women wanted to avoid pregnancy.
        In order to achieve a sustainable future, modern contraceptives and
        Self Care can be effective in overcoming the challenges faced by AGYW(Adolescent Girls and Young Women)
        to better understand their needs for contraception and own the decisions to address them.
        AGYW defined as (15-24 years old) face distinct barriers to obtaining modern contraceptives
        compared with other age groups. <br>
        The continents rate of teenage (15 to 19 years) pregnancy is at 14% and remains higher than other developing
        regions like Asia.There is a high risk of pre term births and sxchool drop outs cuts hence the need of contraceptives.
        Thus we aim on educating the ladies on the available contraceptives and their advantages and disadvantages. 
        We shall also offer counseling and medical connections to these women.
